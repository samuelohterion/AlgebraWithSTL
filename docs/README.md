# AlgebraWithSTL
some algebra with std::vector<T> and std::vector<std::vector<T>>  
This is a small collection of some functions and operator overloadings for convenient work  
with STL std::vector<T> and std::vector<std::vector<T>> as mathematical objects.  

## whetting your appetite   
there are some small neuronal network examples  

## how to build
### Qt-Creator-solution
Easiest way is to compile and start the project in Qt-Creator!  

### otherwise
Create some make file by yourself ( main.cpp depends on algebra.hpp and codeprinter.hpp )  

## Use it!
2. Watch the output!
3. Use the code by yourself!

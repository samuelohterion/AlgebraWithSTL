# AlgebraWithSTL
algebra, some math with std::vector&lt; T > and std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt; T > > 
This is a small collection of some functions and operator overloadings for convenient work
with STL std::vector< T > as a mathematical vector and std::vector< std::vector< T > > as a mathematical matrix.

1. Compile and start the project in Qt-Creator!
2. Watch the output!
3. Use the Code by yourself!

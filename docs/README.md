# AlgebraWithSTL
Some algebra with std::vector<T> and std::vector<std::vector<T>>

## What's this about
This is a small collection of some functions and operator overloadings for convenient work  
with STL std::vector<T> and std::vector<std::vector<T>> as mathematical objects.  

## Whetting your appetite!   
There are some small neuronal network examples  

## How to build?
### Qt-Creator-solution
Easiest way is to compile and start the project in Qt-Creator!  

### Otherwise
Create some make file by yourself and execute it  
    ( main.cpp depends on algebra.hpp and codeprinter.hpp )  

## Then 
1. Start it!
2. Watch the output!
3. Use the code by yourself!

# AlgebraWithSTL
some algebra with std::vector<T> and std::vector<std::vector<T>> 
This is a small collection of some functions and operator overloadings for convenient work
with STL std::vector<T> as a mathematical vector and std::vector<std::vector<T>> as a mathematical matrix.

As some small examples
there are some neuronal networks

## Qt-Creator-solution
1. Easiest way is to compile and start the project in Qt-Creator!
2. Watch the output!
3. Use the code by yourself!

## otherwise
1. Create some make file by yourself ( main.cpp depends on algebra.hpp and codeprinter.hpp )
2. Use it
3. Watch the output!
4. Use the code by yourself!
